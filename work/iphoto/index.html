        <p>iPhotographer Magazine is a lifestyle magazine brand for tablets centered around smartphone photography and everything visual, from tutorials and camera techniques to articles on featured artists.</p>
        <p>Most of the articles I worked on at iPhotographer were mainly tutorials and tips and tricks, but by far the one I favored the most was laying out the article written about Richard Grey.</p>
        <p>This projected really resonated with the photographer within me, the amazing shots Richard Grey was able to accomplish with just a mobile device and some very light image editing still impresses me whenever I see his work.</p>

        <p>The brunt of the layouts were designed using a InDesign plugin app called Mag+. The app itself was very easy to familiarize myself with, thanks to my experience with InDesign. The exporting aspect of the app was very user friendly, allowing for local devices to test the layout and animation schemes.</p>
