        <hr>
        <p>Reframing the tv experience for consumers required various discovery and conception phases, researching the highest level of importance to consumers and detailing those aspects in a informative way.</p>
        <p>Besides highlighting the technology behind the tv it was very important to present the information in a easy to digest format for consumers while trying to maintain a modern and fresh design perspective.</p>

        <h3 class="topmargin" id="key">Key Challenges</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Working for an established company based overseas presented many challenges in the ways of visual design. One of the more common themes was the difference in design languages and design principles based on regions. For example, one location in Asia may favor a design based more on technical specs as a selling point while another region would favor built-in features. This distinction created a very high level issue as the goal of the entire project was to unify the global web marketing brand into a common language.</p>
